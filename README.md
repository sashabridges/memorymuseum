# memorymuseum

A fan-made website dedicated to Magia Record, a phone game spinoff of Puella Magi Madoka Magicka.

This site can be found at [memorymuseum.info](memorymuseum.info).

Current TODOs:
- Webscrape Wikis for unit data to create jsons. *Current Status*: 49 units remain.
- Create a mongo database and upload the jsons.
- Decide on a framework supported by GCP that uses templating. Preferably Vue, because I'm comfortable with it and also very lazy.
- Create an area of the site dedicated to news with pagination.
- News archives
- Magia Record blog?
- Magia Record meta advice?
- Featured units?
