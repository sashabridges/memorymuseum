As long as they stay within this tiny half-planet, they each only believe in what the other can sense; outsiders will never get through to them, no matter how many opinions one expresses or how overbearing an attitude one takes. The use of this Doppel shuts out the diverse values held by others, thereby stabilizing one\\u2019s mind, but as a side effect, their hold on society\\u2019s ethics will dwindle as well.\", \"Ability\": \"Damage All Enemies [VIII] &amp; Accele MP Gain UP (All / 3 T)\"}}"
