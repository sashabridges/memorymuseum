It therefore boasts a high resistance to physical attacks; however, it also envelops enemy and ally alike in its toxicity. Once it appears, its surroundings are contaminated by its gas, and even its master would likely not be able to withstand it if she did not wear a gas mask. It also has a strong curiosity for rare kinds of Witches.\", \"Ability\": \"<td style=\\\"width:25%;text-align:center;\\\"><b>Eng Text</b>\"}}"
